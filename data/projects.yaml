  description: >-
    Multiphysics simulation software designed with a high level of modularity, using concepts from applied category theory to make a tool which allows both rapid modeling as well as fine-tuned descriptions of dynamic systems.
  skills:
    - name: Julia
      desc: The simulation library was written in Julia, using Catlab.jl for model construction and DifferentialEquations.jl for simulation.
    - name: Simulation
      desc: This software generates code which simulates a described physical system.
    - name: Multiphysics
      desc: This software allows users to couple multiple physical phenomena to generate multiphysics simulations.
