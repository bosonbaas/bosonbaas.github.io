I have strong communication skills with experience explaining technical analyses to shareholders and non-technical audiences.</p> <p>I have several years of experience with data analysis, including data ingestion with SQL, cleaning and analysis with Python, SPSS, and Julia, and interpretation and dissemination of results. Additionally, I have experience developing simulation software and a strong background in computational physics.</p> <p>I am familiar with front-end languages and frameworks like HTML, React and Node.js, and interested in gaining more experience in full-stack development. Finally, I am able to rapidly pick up new languages and concepts and to adapt prior experience to novel scenarios.</p>"},{"location":"#job-interests","title":"Job Interests","text":"<p>Fundamentally, I am passionate about jobs which have (1) complex problems and (2) help people. I have found that these requirements really aren't all that restrictive, as (1) most jobs have complex problems if you look hard enouch, and (2) most jobs can be spun as ultimately helping people. Some areas I am particularly interested in working in are:</p> <ul> <li>Data Analysis: I have experience with educational data, but am open to other kinds of data</li> <li>Software Development: Love HPC and simulation work (see portfolio). Also interested in developing front end tools for assisting math educators (also see portfolio)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#personal-interests","title":"Personal Interests","text":"<p>Beyond my non-computer hobbies, like hiking, playing the violin, and making wierd and sometimes tasty foods, I really enjoy:</p> <ul> <li>Data Visualization: I LOVE good data visualization, where good means that the visualization clearly and faithfully highlights patterns and anomalies in the data.</li> <li>Thinking about Formal Reasoning: While this interest was kickstarted by Aquinas, it quickly developed as I learned more about how we use formal reasoning (from mathematical proofs to theology to software design). How do we put two pieces of information together, and come out with certainty about a third? So strange.</li> <li>Leaning New and Useful Tools: If I have a job to do, I love the process and challenge of learning a new tool, moving through the 5 stages of grief to get from not knowing a tool to really grokking it.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"portfolio/","title":"Portfolio","text":"<p>Below, I've included a list of projects in which I have made significant software contributions (or am the sole developer) along with a brief summary and links to relevant resources.</p> Note for Recruiters: The table below only includes projects with a clear software product.
