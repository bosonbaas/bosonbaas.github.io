# Portfolio

Below, I've included a list of projects in which I have made **significant software contributions** (or am the sole developer) along with a brief summary and links to relevant resources.

<details><summary>Note for Recruiters:</summary> The table below only includes projects with a clear software product. Thus, work experience like HPC benchmarking, scripts generated for data processing, and auxiliary front-end development are not included. If you are interested in a comprehensive list, please contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-baas/">LinkedIn</a> for a copy of my CV.</details>
